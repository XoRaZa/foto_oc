<h1>Anti-Fraud</h1>
<h2>Anti-Fraud</h2>
<p>The Anti-Fraud modules can be accessed under <strong>Extensions &gt; Anti-Fraud</strong>. The core fraud handling modules seen below are included with the OpenCart package.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/anti_fraud_modules.png" alt="anti-fraud back end" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>The Anti-Fraud modules need to be installed before they can be enabled for the store. The process of installation is similar to installing an extension under Extensions > Modules in OpenCart. For example, this is how to install the FraudLabs Pro module. First, install the module by clicking on the "Install" button under the "Action" column.  A green stripe will notify you that the module is successfully modified.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/anti_fraud_install.png" alt="anti-fraud back end" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>Once the module is installed, you can edit the module settings. We will start with the configuration of the first module, FraudLabs Pro.</p>
<h2>FraudLabs Pro</h2>
<p>FraudLabs Pro module uses the <a href="http://www.fraudlabspro.com/"> Fraudlabs Pro </a>service to detect possible fraudulent orders.
In order to use the Fraudlabs Pro service, you have to obtain an API key first and place it in the OpenCart module settings.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_1.png" alt="FraudLabs Pro back end" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In order to obtain the API key you need to register in the FraudLabs Pro service. There are several pricing plans, including a free plan. The different plans offer different amount of monthly queries (orders) and different amount of validation rules. The validation rules are customizable rules that you can configure in addition to the other checks that FraudLabs Pro makes when screening an order.</p>
<p>After configuring and enabling the module in OpenCart, each of the orders made in your store will go through FraudLabs system and get screened for any potential fraud. Once an order is checked from the FraudLabs Pro service it is being given a certain status and a score. There are three possible fraud validation statuses: Approved, Rejected or Pending Review. The score is a value from 0-100, presenting the probability that an order can be fraudulent. The bigger the number is the more risky an order is.</p>
<p>The OpenCart FraudLabs Pro module is configured based on the <strong>Score</strong> and the Fraudlabs Pro <strong>status</strong> for each order.</p>
<h3>Risk Score</h3>
<p>Once checked, each order is being given a certain Score. You can check what Score each order has in the FraudLabs Pro user panel.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_2.png" alt="FraudLabsPro user panel" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In OpenCart FraudLabs Pro module you have to configure a <strong>Risk Score</strong>, which will be compared to the <strong>Score</strong> of the order from the FraudLabs Pro service. Also an Order Status should be configured in the module. This <strong>Order Status</strong> will be applied to the order in your store in case the <strong>Score</strong> (the one that comes from the FraudLabs Pro service) is bigger than the <strong>Risk Score</strong> (the one configured in the OpenCart module). You can choose from all the available OpenCart Order Statuses.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_3.png" alt="FraudLabsPro Risk Score" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Based on the results status from the FraudLabs service, an order will have one of the following statuses: Approved, Rejected or Pending Review.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_4.png" alt="FraudLabsPro transaction listing" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In OpenCart FraudLabs Pro module, you should configure what Order Status to be applied to each order, for each of the FraudLabs Pro service order statuses. 
For example, if the FraudLabs Pro gives a <strong>Rejected</strong> status to an order, the OpenCart order status can be configured to change to &quot;<strong>Denied</strong>&quot;.  Different Order Statuses have to be applied for the three FraudLabs Pro service.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_5.png" alt="FraudLabsPro rules validation" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In order to test the configuration of the module, you can use the Simulate IP field. If you add an IP address in this field then all of the orders made in your store will be logged with this IP for the FraudLabs Pro service.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/fraudlabspro_6.png" alt="FraudLabsPro rules testing" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>More features can be found in the control panel from FraudLabs Pro panel:<a href="https://www.fraudlabspro.com/merchant/dashboard">https://www.fraudlabspro.com/merchant/dashboard</a></p>
<h2>Risk Score</h2>
<p>The second anti-fraud module in OpenCart is the Anti-Fraud IP. This module handles the possible fraudulent orders based on the customer IP addresses. The module allows you to create manually a list of fraud IP addresses.  
The fraud IP addresses list is configured from : <strong>Anti-Fraud IP > IP Addresses >  Fraud IP Address List</strong> .</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/antifraudip_1.png" alt="Anti-Fraud IP fraud IP addresses" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In OpenCart, there is an IP addresses log for each customer. In case that there is a fraud IP address in the list of customer IP addresses, then an order will not automatically change its status to completed. Also, the module will change the order status to the one priorly configured in <strong>Anti-Fraud IP > General > Order Status</strong>.</p>

<h2>MaxMind Anti-Fraud</h2>
<p>The second service based fraud handling module in OpenCart is MaxMind Anti-Fraud. In order to use the module you have to obtain a license key from MaxMind <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/minfraud-services">minFraud</a> service and place it in the OpenCart module settings.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/maxmindantifraud_1.png" alt="MaxMind Anti-Fraud general" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>The minFraud service customers pass to minFraud system the service information provided by their site visitors during online transactions and account registrations. The minFraud service analyzes this information and returns a Risk Score. Risk Score ranges from 0.01-100.00 and represents the probability that a given transaction is fraudulent.
Once an order is placed in your OpenCart store, the order transaction is scanned in the minFraud system. Once checked, each order is being given a certain Risk Score. You can check what Score each order has in the minFraud user panel (minFraud Query History). </p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/maxmindantifraud_2.png" alt="MaxMind minFruad user panel" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>In OpenCart MaxMind Anti-Fraud module you have to configure a Risk Score, which will be compared to the <strong>Risk Score</strong> of the order from the minFraud service. Also, an Order Status should be set in the module. This Order Status will be applied to the order in your store in case the <strong> Risk Score </strong>(the one that comes from the minFraud service) is bigger than the <strong>Risk Score</strong> (the one configured in the OpenCart module). Furthermore, the order will not be allowed to reach the complete status automatically. </p>
