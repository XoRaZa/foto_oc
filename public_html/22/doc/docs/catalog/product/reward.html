<h2>Reward Points Tab</h2>
<p>Reward points is a feature of OpenCart that assigns customers &quot;loyalty points&quot; for purchasing products from the store. Customers can use these acquired points as a currency to purchase products from the store. You can assign this product a certain number of reward points required for a customer to purchase it with. If you don&#39;t want to allow this product to be bought with reward points, you can simply leave this area blank.</p>
