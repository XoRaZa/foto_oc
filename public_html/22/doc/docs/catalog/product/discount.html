  <li><strong>Priority</strong>: Adding a priority number such as 1, 2, or 3, will determine when this discount will be used when other discounts are applied to a customer&#39;s order. 1 will apply this discount first, while 2 will apply it second, and so on.</li>

  <li><strong>Date Start</strong>: The first date the discount will be applied.</li>
