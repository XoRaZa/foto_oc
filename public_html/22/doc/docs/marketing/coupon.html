<h2>Coupons in the store front</h2>
<p>Adding and editing coupons in the administration affect the use of coupons in the Shopping Cart and Checkout in the store front.</p>
<h2>Shopping cart</h2>
<p>To enable the use of Coupons in the store front, the coupon extension must be enabled by you under the <a href="extension/order-total/">Order Totals</a> extension. For the customer to use the &quot;-10.00 Discount&quot; coupon, they must first add the product to their cart from the product page, then enter the code in the Shopping Cart. They can select &quot;Use Coupon Code&quot;, enter the coupon code in the space provided, then add &quot;Apply Coupon&quot;.</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="image/marketing-coupons-front.png" alt="coupon acer" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>
<p>Applying the coupon will subtract the coupon discount from the original total. A newly discounted total will be shown under the Coupon(code) total in the order totals section.</p>

<h2>Checkout</h2>
