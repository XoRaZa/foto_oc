<h1>IP Blacklist</h1>
<h2>IP Blacklist</h2>
<p>OpenCart provides a feature called &quot;IP Blacklist&quot; that will ban an IP address from logging into the store. This step may become necessary if the shop is being harassed by a fraudulent &quot;customer&quot;. If you are experiencing harassment from a particular person, their IP address can be copied from the customer list under Sales &gt; Customers &gt; Customers. Copy that IP address and go to Sales &gt; Customers &gt; IP Blacklist. Click the &quot;Insert&quot; button and paste in the IP address to ban a customer from the store. This will stop users of this IP address from logging into the store again.</p>
