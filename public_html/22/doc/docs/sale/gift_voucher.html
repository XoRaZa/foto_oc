<h1>Gift Vouchers</h1>
<h2>Gift Vouchers</h2>
<p>Gift vouchers can be individually sent to customers through their email by other customers in the store front. The customer receiving the gift certificate can use the code provided in the email at the shopping cart to deduct the gift voucher amount from the order total. To manage the Gift Vouchers of the store, go to Sales &gt; Gift Vouchers &gt; Gift Vouchers.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Gift Vouchers only have one use per customer. If the customer uses the same code for another order, OpenCart will display the warning &quot;Warning: Gift Voucher is either invalid or the balance has been used up!&quot;</div>
<h2>General tab</h2>
